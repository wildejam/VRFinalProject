# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade
Clawston: Wielder of the Claw
Jamison Wilder

## Project Description
CLAWSTON: WIELDER OF THE CLAW is a VR experience where you get to BECOME the claw machine, and use your own mechanical skills to carve a path to riches and fame instead of relying on some cheap metal!
In this project, you play as CLAWSTON, and use a Meta Quest controls to move yourself around the claw machine, drop yourself onto the sea of riches, and physically grab objects with your own two arms.
The goal will be to grab and deliver as many objects as possible using these controls, which *ideally* should be a lot easier than a usual arcade claw machine.

## Feature Breakdown
- **Lateral movement within a confined space** -- Difficulty: 3 -- Movement shouldn't be too difficult, but I have never programmed granular movement with an analog stick, which is what I plan on doing for this movement, so this could take longer than expected.

- **Vertical movement** -- Difficulty: 3 -- I worry about the motion sick aspect of this feature, but other than that I think this should be relatively easy to program. Press a button, move down, then move back up.

- **Grabbing objects by Hugging** -- Difficulty: 8 -- Potentially the hardest part of this project, as the physics need to feel reasonable to the player. I'm not sure how to go about designing the colliders and physics involved, but I think that I have enough conceptual understanding to be able to figure it out.

- **Receptacle and point system** -- Difficulty : 2 -- When an object enters the receptacle, increase a score. This feels pretty straightforward.

- **Visual Style and polish** -- Difficulty: 5 -- Despite being purely cosmetic, I believe that style is important to contributing to the arcade theme. I am no artist or 3D modeler, so I worry about how some of my style ideas might be unrealistic to implement.

- **Music and Sound effects** -- Difficulty: 4 -- I am a musician/audio nerd, so I'm not worried about the quality of this category. Only how long I might take creating those assets.

## Milestones
- **__11/19__** -- Have basic environment set up (claw machine interior), along with objects to grab and basic lateral movement. No grabbing required yet--just get the environment ready.
- **__12/5__** -- All basic game features implemented (grabbing, movement, score, timers). The collider problem should be figured out by now. Should feel like a full on game. There also should be *some* assets present, even if they all won't be used in the final product. No default unity materials/textures.
- **12/12** -- Finishing touches, polish, QA, testing.

## Inspirations
- **Pierhead Arcade 2** -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/572620/Pierhead_Arcade_2/ -- Huge inspiration for the arcade aesthetic, as well as some basic VR fundamentals!
- **Duck Steason** -- https://store.steampowered.com/app/503580/Duck_Season/ -- Inspiration for the idea of placing the player inside of the game, with the idea that they are being controlled by someone else.
